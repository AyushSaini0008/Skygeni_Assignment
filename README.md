This project is a data analysis notebook aimed at exploring client distribution across industries and analyzing client renewal behavior. Using Python with libraries like pandas and plotly, the notebook processes a dataset (industry_client_details.csv) that contains client information, including their industry. It visualizes how clients are distributed across various sectors using an interactive pie chart, making it easier to understand industry-wise representation. Additionally, if the dataset includes a renewed column indicating whether a client has renewed (with 1 for yes and 0 for no), the notebook calculates the renewal rate for each industry. This renewal rate is computed as the mean of the renewed values, helping to reveal retention patterns across industries. The notebook is designed for use in a Jupyter environment and serves as a simple yet effective tool for visualizing and interpreting client-related data.
